Finn McLaughlin - Fallout PipBoy 300 UI

My Sci-Fi UI Assignment is based off the popular video game "Fallout 4" and the portable computer that the player wears on his wrist, 
called the "PipBoy".

The game features 5 main tabs, STAT (Status), INV (Inventory), DATA, MAP, and RADIO, some of which have sub-tabs, but all of which has their own features and information for the player.

###STAT
The Status tab shows information about the Player's health and abilities. This tab features 3 sub-tabs, "Status", "S.P.E.C.I.A.L", and "Perks".

The Status tab features a diagram of the Player with health bars to represent the condition of their limbs. If the stimpak (The syringe in which you heal yourself in the game)  button is pressed, the players broken limb is fixed, and their health increases.

The S.P.E.C.I.A.L tab features a list of the abilities the player has, and a number value and a brief description of the ability associated with it. These depict how easy and hard certain aspects of the game are to the player.

The Perks tab features the active perks the player has, along with a brief description of what the perk does. Perks give the Player certain abilities within the game.

###INV
Inventory shows everything the player is carrying. This tab features 4 sub-tabs, "Weapons", "Apparel", "Aid", and "Misc". You can view each item by scrolling over it's name. The items in the Aid, and Misc tab feature a description of the items

###DATA
The Data tab shows a list of the active Quests that the player has to do, as well as general statistics of things the Player has done and accomplished while playing the game. A description of the quests can be seen by scrolling over it's name

###MAP
The Map tab shows a map of the world the player is in. Points of interest that the player has discovered or knows of are highlighted in green and the name of each location can be seen by scrolling over the icon.

###RADIO
The Radio tab gives the player an option of stations to play music on while they play the game. The tab features 3 radio stations, "Classic Radio", "Diamond City", and "Military Radio Station". When clicking on the selected station the radio waves begin to play as well as the music file. Music can be shut off by pressing on the station again.
